# Quik

Go somewhere, quik.

![Example use](example/example.gif)

quik lets you define bookmarked directories to quickly go to.
For example:

``` shell
$ quik add docs "$HOME/Documents"
"docs" ‚Üí "/home/user/Documents"
$ quik docs
$ pwd
/home/user/Documents
```

## Quick Start

``` shell
git clone https://github.com/mikeevmm/quik
cd quik
python install.py
quik --help
```

## Why Quik

quik is mostly Python. This makes its source code easier to read (as compared
to something written in bash), and easier to port to other terminals (like Zsh
of Fish), as only the [bash contents](internals/quik_setup.sh) need to be
ported.

As a testament to this, as of version 2.3, `quik` is also compatible with
Windows, via the [batch port of that file](internals/quik_setup.bat), and as of
2.4 also via the [PowerShell port](internals/quik_setup.ps1)! ‚ù§Ô∏è

### Supported Shells

- [x] Bash
- [x] Command Prompt
- [x] PowerShell

### I Would Like to Contribute With a Port for my Shell

Such pull requests are very welcome.

If you are interested in doing so, all that you need to do is create a file in
the style of [`quik_setup.sh`](internals/quik_setup.sh) for your shell, and
indicate in your pull request how this file should be used in your shell (i.e.,
whether it should be sourced at the start of each session, ran at the start of
each session, or something else).

I have made an attempt to thoroughly comment
[`quik_setup.sh`](internals/quik_setup.sh), so it should be easy to follow and
write analogous code for your shell.
